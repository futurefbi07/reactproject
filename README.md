## Introduction
The starter code for this project was provided by <a href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game">Udacity</a>. I have added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template using React.

## About the App

This app allows you to select and categorize books you have are currently reading, or want to read, or have read. Your books will be categorized in a library on the main page. The main page has a link (+) on the bottom right right corner, will direct you to the a search page, where you can find books to add to your library.

You can navigate from the search page back to the main page by clicking the left (<-) arrow at the of the page. Once you a are back on the main page, you will instantly see all of the selections you made on the search page in the library.

## How to Run the Project

Make sure you have a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js"</a> installed on your computer.
Download or clone this repository.
From inside the new directory:
install all project dependencies with npm install
start the server with npm start
Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
